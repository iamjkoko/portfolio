            <h4>Paintbox is a multifunctional tool that combines both <strong>practicality and functionality</strong>. Designed to store essential painting materials such as brushes, paints, and palettes, the box transforms into a <strong>self-supporting easel</strong>. The piece is built entirely from cardboard <strong>without the use of glue or tape</strong>, which showcases the possibilities of engineering and design through simple yet effective construction methods.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>The <strong>complete absence of adhesives</strong>, which is the main focus of the project, not only emphasizes sustainability but also highlights the creative problem-solving and craftsmanship involved in its assembly. Through this process, the work becomes more than just a functional objectâ€”it represents the power of design in which utilizes eco-friendly materials.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>All in all, the project allows viewers to <strong>rethink everyday materials</strong> and discover the <strong>potential for innovation in even the simplest of tools</strong>, inspiring creativity in both art and design.</h4>
